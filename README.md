# NLP_Project_Prediction_Model
This NLP Project is based on the Drugs Reviews dataset.
I have built ML model to predict the illness of the patients on the basis of drug review passed by the patients.
Performed detailed analysis of drug reviews given by patients.
Plotted Word Cloud for better visualization of most frequently occuring words 
Performed Data Cleaning by using specific NLTK  libraries like StopWords, BeautifulSoup, regular expression.
Built and Evaluated several Machine Learning Models using Bag_of_words / TF-IDF / Passive Aggressive Classifier.
Finally selected a model with adequetly satisfying performance built on PassiveAggressiveClassifier using TF-IDF Trigram
